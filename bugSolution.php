This corrected version uses strict comparison (===) instead of loose comparison (==). The strict comparison ensures that both the value and the type of the variables are compared which prevents the unexpected behavior caused by type juggling.

```php
<?php
$stringZero = '0';
$integerZero = 0;

if ($stringZero === $integerZero) {
    echo "Variables are strictly equal";
} else {
    echo "Variables are not strictly equal";
}
?>
```
